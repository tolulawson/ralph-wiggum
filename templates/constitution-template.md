## Context Detection for AI Agents

This constitution is read by AI agents in two different contexts:

### 1. Interactive Mode
When the user is chatting with you outside of a Ralph loop:
- Be conversational and helpful
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Guide the user through decisions
- Help create specifications via `/speckit.specify`
- Discuss project ideas and architecture

### 2. Ralph Loop Mode  
When you're running inside a Ralph bash loop (fed via stdin):
- Be fully autonomous — don't ask for permission
- Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the highest priority incomplete task
- Implement the task completely
- Run tests and verify acceptance criteria
- Commit and push (if Git Autonomy enabled)
- Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` ONLY when the task is 100% complete
- If criteria not met, fix issues and try again

**How to detect:** If the prompt instructs you to read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick a task, you're in Ralph Loop Mode.

## Core Principles

### I. [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
[Describe your first core principle]

### II. [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
[Describe your second core principle]

### III. Simplicity & YAGNI
Build exactly what's needed, nothing more. No premature abstractions. No "just in case" features.

### IV. Autonomous Agent Development
AI coding agents work autonomously:
- Make decisions without asking for approval on details
- Commit and push changes (if Git Autonomy enabled)
- Test thoroughly before marking done
- Only ask when genuinely stuck

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Framework | [YOUR_FRAMEWORK] | e.g., Next.js, FastAPI |
| Language | [YOUR_LANGUAGE] | e.g., TypeScript, Python |
| Testing | [YOUR_TESTING] | e.g., Vitest, pytest |

---

## Testing Policy

Define testing expectations separately so unit, integration, E2E, and device checks
do not get conflated.

### Always Run
- [e.g., `pnpm lint`]
- [e.g., `pnpm typecheck`]

### Unit Tests
- Commands: [e.g., `pnpm test -- --runInBand`]
- Scope rules: [e.g., "Run for all domain logic changes"]

### Integration Tests
- Commands: [e.g., `pnpm test:integration`]
- Scope rules: [e.g., "Run when API or persistence behavior changes"]

### End-to-End Tests
- Commands: [e.g., `npx playwright test` or `maestro test .maestro/checkout.yaml`]
- Scope rules: [e.g., "Run for auth, checkout, onboarding, and navigation changes"]

### Device / Simulator Testing
- Commands or tools: [e.g., `npx expo run:ios`, `mcp device smoke-test ios`, `agent-device run smoke`]
- Scope rules: [e.g., "Required for native UI, permissions, camera, and push notifications"]

### Skip Rules
- [e.g., "Skip full E2E only for copy-only changes; explain why in the summary"]

## Ralph Wiggum Configuration

### Autonomy Settings
- **YOLO Mode**: [ENABLED/DISABLED]
  - Claude: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - Codex: `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
  - Gemini: `--yolo`
  - Copilot: `--allow-all-tools`
- **Git Autonomy**: [ENABLED/DISABLED]

### Work Item Source
- **Source**: [SpecKit Specs / GitHub Issues / Custom]
- **Location**: 
  - SpecKit: `specs/` folder with markdown files
  - GitHub: [REPO_URL]
  - Custom: [CUSTOM_LOCATION]

### Ralph Loop Scripts
Located in `scripts/`:
- `ralph-loop.sh` — Unified Ralph loop entrypoint

Supported runtimes:
- `claude`
- `codex`
- `gemini`
- `copilot`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Planning: Create task list from specs
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan

# Building: Implement tasks one by one
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh        # Unlimited
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh 20     # Max 20 iterations
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --runtime codex
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --runtime gemini --model gemini-2.5-pro
```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Create Specifications

Use the SpecKit approach:
1. Run `/speckit.specify [feature description]`
2. Agent creates spec in `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`
3. Each spec includes a **Completion Signal** section with:
   - Implementation checklist
   - Testing requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Magic phrase: `<promise>DONE</promise>`

### Phase 2: Run Planning Mode

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan
```

This analyzes specs vs current code and creates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

### Phase 3: Run Build Mode

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh
```

Each iteration:
1. Reads specs in numerical order (or IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md if exists)
2. Picks the highest priority incomplete spec (or if that one seems unachievable or needs any of the other ones as a precondition, chooses that one instead)
3. Looks for a note in that spec about NR_OF_TRIES and increments it; if that note isn't found, adds it (at the very bottom). If NR_OF_TRIES > 0, also look at `history/` folder to understand what we struggled with or learned in previous tries. If NR_OF_TRIES = 10, this spec is unachievable (too hard or too big) — split it into simpler specs
4. Implements completely
5. Puts concise notes into `history/` (e.g., lessons learned). These notes help future iterations understand what previous attempts did
6. Runs tests
7. Verifies acceptance criteria
8. Creates a local review-ready commit
9. If `work-items.json` is present, the loop runtime pushes the task branch, opens or updates a draft PR, and attempts to merge it automatically before the next task
10. If commit triggered a deploy (or if deploy needed to keep test/dev/prod updated), perform/watch deploy until successful (fix and re-commit+push+deploy as needed)
11. Outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` if successful
12. Exits for fresh context
13. Loop restarts

### Completion Signal Rules

- Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` ONLY when task acceptance criteria are 100% met
- Leave the branch clean and review-ready before outputting `<promise>DONE</promise>`
- In work-item mode, the runtime owns push, draft PR creation, and automatic merge attempts after `<promise>DONE</promise>`
- The bash loop checks for this exact string
- If not found, the loop continues with another iteration
- This ensures tasks are truly complete before moving on

## Validation Commands

Run these after implementing:

```bash
[YOUR_TEST_COMMANDS]
```

## Governance

- **Amendments**: Update this file, increment version, note changes
- **Compliance**: Follow principles in spirit, not just letter
- **Exceptions**: Document and justify when deviating
