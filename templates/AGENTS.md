# Agent Instructions

## Quick Start

**To start Ralph loop:**
```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh
```

This works directly from specs — no planning step needed.

---

## How Ralph Works

1. Agent reads `specs/` folder
2. Picks the **highest priority incomplete spec** (lowest number first)
3. Implements it completely
4. Marks spec as `COMPLETE`
5. Outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>`
6. Loop restarts with fresh context
7. Repeat until all specs are done

---

## Project Constitution

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles.

---

## Spec Priority

Specs are numbered: `001-xxx`, `002-xxx`, etc.
- Lower number = higher priority
- Work on incomplete specs in order

---

## Optional: Planning Mode

Only if you need detailed task breakdown:
```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan --prd docs/PRD.md
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan --notes docs/ideas.md
```

**Most projects don't need this** — specs are the plan.
When you do use it, Ralph should orchestrate the SpecKit phases in order:
`speckit-specify -> speckit-clarify -> speckit-plan -> speckit-tasks`.
